DNA Sequence to AA Sequence Translation Tool and Restriction site finder tool

This is a tool to transalte DNA sequences into amino acid sequences and identify restriction enzyme cut sites.

To run:
1. If you do not have Anaconda installed on your system download and install Anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual.
2. Open Jupyter notebook on your computer.
3. Jupyter notebook will open in Chrome browser.
4. Use the file browser to open the file: Sequence_coursework.ipynb
5. This code works with .txt files of DNA sequences containing only the letters g, c, a, t.  
6. To change the DNA sequence being translated place the file in the working directory
   change the file name in cells 2,3 and re run the code.
7. The translated amino acid sequence will be outputted in the notebook below cell 6.
8. The restriction sites identified will be outputted below cell 8.
